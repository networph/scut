## Built With

    Bash: scut is fundamentally crafted using Bash scripting, providing a robust mechanism for managing shell command shortcuts efficiently and effectively. The scripts cater to creating, listing, favoriting, and managing shortcuts directly from your terminal, embedding themselves into your .bashrc for persistence and ease of use.

This platform provides users with detailed information, documentation, and the ability to download or clone the project for personal or developmental use.
